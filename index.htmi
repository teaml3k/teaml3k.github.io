  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><strong>Founder:</strong> 조병근</p>

  <p>
    L3K is a rework-based clothing brand founded by 조병근.
    Shaped by experience as a composer and a refined understanding of brand culture,
    L3K approaches fashion as a form of creative expression rather than mass production.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each garment is reconstructed or designed to stand as a one-of-a-kind piece,
    inspired by street culture, global aesthetics, and sustainable fashion practices.
    The focus is placed on individuality, raw design language, and narrative value.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Brand Story</h2>
  <p>
    L3K began with a simple idea: clothing can carry more meaning than function.
    Through rework, modification, and intentional imperfection,
    existing garments are given a new identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every cut, texture, and detail reflects a balance between chaos and structure.
    Rather than following trends, L3K builds collections that exist independently,
    allowing the wearer to connect with the story behind each piece.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Limited Edition</h2>
  <p>
    Selected L3K products are released in strictly limited quantities.
    Once sold out, they will not be reproduced.
    Each item exists as a standalone statement rather than part of mass circulation.
